Lab 2 assignment

I created a simple HTML website based on a university theme to showcase how academic information can be structured online. The site includes a homepage with the university name, logo, and a brief welcome message, followed by navigation links to pages such as "About."

-index.html: Contains styling, lists. Semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>.
-about.html: Sections, lists, definition lists and Pdf.
-media.html: `<picture>` responsive image, audio, video.
-extras.html: Contains a table.

`<details>`, `<dialog open>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`.
